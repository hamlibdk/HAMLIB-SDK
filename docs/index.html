	<h3>What is this kit for?</h3>
	<ul>
		<p>The <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/">HAMLIB SDK</a> is a collection of Open Source and Not-For-Commercial-Use software  that has been packaged to support the development of <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib/">Hamlib</a> and Windows software that uses Hamlib.</p>
		<p>The scripts and packages provided assist with the construction of <a href="https://www.qt.io/download-open-source#section-2>Qt</a>-based environment are provided that enable <a href=" https: physics.princeton.edu pulsar k1jt wsjtx.html>WSJT-X</a> and derivatives <a href="https://jtdx.tech/en/">JTDX</a> and <a href="http://js8call.com/">JS8CALL</a> - collectively referred to as <strong>JT-ware</strong>.</p>
		<p>Work on Hamlib is very dynamic. The kit permits up-to-the-second changes in <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib/">Hamlib</a> source to be compiled into to released JT-ware source, thus allowing end users the opportunity to compile a JT-ware package that better supports their radio and/or other hardware. It takes pressure off JT-ware developers as many end-user issues can often be traced to small glitches in the very dynamic Hamlib suite.</p>
		<p>By empowering end users with the ability to easily and simply compile and examine the Open Source software it increases the general skill base and reputation of the Amateur Radio community at-large.</p>
	</ul>
	<h3>How is the kit constructed?</h3>
	<ul>
		<p>The kit is based around the <a href="https://www.qt.io/download-open-source#section-2">Qt for Open Source Development</a> , <a href="https://www.msys2.org/">MSYS2</a> and <a href="https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell">PowerShell</a> environments supported through a rich set of easily accessible environment variables.</p>
	</ul>
	<h3>What are the legalities of using this kit?</h3>
	<ul>
		<p>This package has been compiled in good faith to support research and academic learning.</p>

	<h3>Ancestry</h3>
	<ul>
		<p>These kits evolve and continue work and techniques first developed by <a href="https://github.com/KI7MT">Greg Beam KI7MT</a> and retains its name <strong>JTSDK</strong> to respect his fine work and techniques. Future kits as they evolve into supporting software that is not considered <strong>JT-ware</strong> may revert to the nomenclature <strong>HAMLIB SDK</strong>.</p>
		<p>This (and future work) must acknowledge <a href="https://github.com/KI7MT">Greg Beam KI7MT</a>'s' work and Copyright. Subsequent work based off these resouces must also repect the work and Copyright of current Hamlib SDK Developers (Termed "hamlibdk"). </p>
