<h2>JTSDK 3.2.2 User's Guide</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Direction</h3>
<ul>
	<p>The <strong>JTSDK 3.2.2</strong> evolves the kits from Windows Batch Files towards Windows 
	<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">PowerShell</a>-based scripts. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">PowerShell</a> is also supported in Mac and 
	Linux environs, so common-adaptation for these purposes may occur as the kits evolve. </p>
	<p>This started as an experiment to reduce maintenance (i.e. new package versions). 
	The deployment environment <strong> jtsdk64-setup.ps1</strong> will always require hard-coded 
	base package support. Once an environment is set up maintenance tasks are simplified.</p>
	<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">PowerShell</a> eclipses the capabilities of Windows Batch files. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">PowerShell</a> 
	completely removes needs for capable third-party environments such as <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>.</p>
</ul>
<h3>The Version 3.2 Base Stream</h3>
<ul>
	<p>The <strong>Version 3.2</strong> stream is a learning, discovery and technique refinement experiment. </p>
</ul>
<h3>Version 3.2.2</h3>
<ul>
	<p>The <strong>JTSDK 3.2.2</strong> outwardly will appear similar to the <strong>JTSDK 3.2.1</strong>-stream. Yet the 
	<strong>JTSDK 3.2.2</strong> has significant enhancements in that many of the key commands now accept 
	switches that can make the process of developing code quicker and simpler.</p>
	<p>In addition the &quot;mirroring&quot; of <strong>build-hamlib.sh</strong> and <strong>build-hamlib.sh-static</strong> has been 
	broken - with <strong>build-hamlib.sh</strong> offering a number of additional command-line switches to 
	aid developers.</p>
	<p>The <strong>JTSDK 3.2.2</strong> solves a long standing issue with <a href="https://libusb.info/">LibUSB</a>  support - that up until now has been 
	disabled. Most changes in this preview incorporate enhancements to the MSYS2 environment 
	to better support the <a href="https://libusb.info/">LibUSB</a>  with Hamlib.</p>
</ul>

<ul>
	<p><strong>The project needs contributors - especially with better colour tastes - to write better documentation than what can be found here !!!</strong></p>

<h3>Project Status</h3>
<ul>
	<p>This project is now at the <strong>Release</strong> phase of its life cycle. Primary objectives have 
	been met (i.e. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">PowerShell</a> conversion, Ability to compile latest source code to bleeding-edge Hamlib code). </p>
	<p>Future kits will be much smaller in distribution size. You will be required to 
	build libraries (i.e. <a href="https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_80_0.html">Boost 1.80.0</a> ) as part of the learning process.</p>
	<p>Current packaging methods also preempts known cases of proposed licence and delivery condition changes. </p>
</ul>

<ul>
	Precompiled drop-in packages for <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/Boost-1.74.0-MinGW-v7.3-v8.1.7z">Boost-1.74.0</a>, <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/Boost-1.77.0-MinGW-v7.3-v8.1.7z">Boost-1.77.0</a> , <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/Boost-1.78.0-MinGW-v7.3-v8.1.7z">Boost-1.78.0</a> and <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/Boost-1.79.0-MinGW-v8.1-v11.2.7z">Boost-1.79.0</a> are available - saving many hours.. </p>

	  <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/Boost-1.79.0-MinGW-v8.1-v11.2.7z">Boost-1.79.0</a> and <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/Boost-1.80.0-MinGW-v8.1-v11.2.7z">Boost-1.80.0</a> is built with and supplied under Qt's MinGW 8.1 and MinGW 11.3 environs. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>Extract the folder for the Boost version-package that you want to use into <strong>x:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\boost</strong> (create the directory if it does not exist) and then remove the -7.3, -8.1 or -11.2 suffix !</p>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
	<p>The recommended mainstream development environments are <a href="https://www.qt.io/download-open-source">Qt 5.15.2</a> and <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/Boost-1.80.0-MinGW-v8.1-v11.2.7z">Boost-1.80.0</a> working with <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MSYS2 MinGW</a> 8.1.</p>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>The Next Steps</h3>
<ul>
	<p>Version 4 of the JTSDK will involve strategic re-think. Watch the <a href="https://groups.io/g/JTSDK/messages">JTSDK Forum</a> for updates.</p>
</ul>
<h3>Kit Construction</h3>
<ul>
	<p>Most configuration is now based on either marker files in <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools\config</strong> 
	or specified package versions listed in <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools\config\Versions.ini</strong> . 
	See the <a href="https://groups.io/g/JTSDK/messages">JTSDK Forum</a> and post comments (or email main contributors found there).</p>
	</ul>
<h3>Support</h3>
<ul>													
	<p>Heads-up advice from developers is essential. We are not &#39;enemies&#39;; we are just 
	inquisitive. <strong>Nobody asked us to do this - Nobody should have to ask in the AR community</strong>. 
	Maintainers work on this to learn. We support the development of the skill base 
	and hence reputation of Amateur Radio.</p>
</ul>
<h3>Added Support and Features</h3>
<ul>
	<p>The <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/Tests/">Tests</a> folder  contains bleeding-edge  efforts to translate and improve 
	scripts. Some past scripts may not be able to be eliminated easily or in fact be 
	converted at all.</p>
	<p>Support for following technologies are <strong>added/enhanced</strong> in these streams:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Hamlib support for other non-JT- software packages (will occur silently???).</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.qt.io/download-open-source">Qt</a>&#39;s incorporated CMAKE</li>
	<li>The version of <a href="https://www.boost.org/">Boost</a> can be selected in <strong>Version.inf</strong> and will be compiled to the selected version of Qt (including its MinGW release).</li>
	<li>Greater package version self-configuration - hence <strong>less maintenance required</strong>.</li>
	<li>Upgrades to &quot;static&quot; apps that have no generically named latest-version sources</li>
</ul>
<p>The versions of packages supported are now able to be edited into the kit in one 
place - the <strong>Versions.ini</strong> file. This makes maintenance tasks easier.</p>
</ul>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ul>
	<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">PowerShell</a> scripts are managed to tight security rules. See the next section.</p>
	<p>The kits may never be able to move away from the Windows CMD processor and its &quot;Batch 
	files&quot; in order to compile JT- software.</p>
	<p>Operational techniques have already evolved  i.e. the need for <strong>qt-gen-tc</strong> has been 
	eliminated. Some needed techniques to support &#39;familiarity&#39; also have limits. Ways that 
	processes are executed may change.</p>
</ul>

<h2>PowerShell Security Warnings</h2>	
<hr>
<ul>
	<p>You may receive the following <strong>security notification</strong>:</p>
</ul>
<div class="reducewidth">
<pre>
Execution Policy Change
The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing 
the execution policy might expose you to the security risks described in the 
about_Execution_Policies help topic at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. 
Do you want to change the execution policy?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"):
</pre>
</div>
<ul>
	<p>It is safe to select <strong>Y</strong>. These scripts are not any processor flaw tests. Remember
	that developing these scripts is also a learning exercise for the Development Team.</p>
</ul>
<h3>Windows Environment Variables</h3>
<ul>
	<p>The basic concept of supporting <strong>Windows Environment Variables</strong> through <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">PowerShell</a> <strong>$env:<env-var></strong> facilities that ease access into CMake, QMake and the MinGW compilers - components that will always remain a cornerstone concepts.</p>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Upgrades</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
	<p>The <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/JTSDK64-Base-3.2.2.exe">JTSDK64-Base-3.2.2</a> can be installed over the top of previous kits - yet it is 
	highly recommended that one start from scratch. </p>
	<p><strong> It is highly recommended that kits are deployed into Virtual machines (see &quot;Deployment&quot; section).</strong> </p>
	<p>It is highly recommended that a new, fresh deployment be considered with each new base package release.</p>
	<p>You can keep old deployment(s) by closing all open environment windows and renaming the deployment folder (i.e. <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools</strong> to <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools-Old</strong>) </p>
	<p>If you need to revert back to your old deployment then all you need do is rename that folder back to its original filename (i.e. <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools-Old</strong> back to <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools</strong>) </p>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Maintenance Updates: &quot;Tools&quot; Packages</h2>
<hr>

<ul>
	<p>Maintenance updates will be applied in the form of &quot;Tools&quot; packages. These packages 
	are designed to be deployed to existing &quot;Base&quot; packages.</p>
</ul>
	<table width="*" align="center" border="1">
		<tr>
			<td class="custd"><strong>It is ESSENTIAL that any available 'Tools' packages be applied to a 'Base' package.</strong></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
<p></p>
<ul>
	<p>You do not need to apply previous 'Tools' packages. Just deploy the latest 'Tools' package that is available.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
	<p>&quot;Tools&quot; packages are updates to the &quot;Base&quot; environments.</p>
	<p><em>These steps assume that you have a deployed base environment</em></p>
	<ul>
	<li>Download any &quot;Tools&quot; packages from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> The current &quot;Tools&quot; package is <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/JTSDK64-Tools-3.2.2.5.exe">JTSDK64-Tools-3.2.2.5.exe</a>.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Deploy the tools package to your JTSDK install directory.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Updates may apply to the MSYS2 environment. Therefore the &quot;profile&quot; directory for 
	MSYS2 must be deleted and re-created.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Copy any folders stored under <strong>x:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\msys64\home</strong> to a backup location. This should enable you to access previous work.</li>
	<li>Close any open MSYS2 environment terminal(s).</li>
	<li>Perform the system upgrade.</li>
	<li>Delete folders that exist under <strong>x:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\msys64\home</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>i.e: PowerShell: <strong> Remove-Item &quot;C:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\msys64\home*&quot; -Recurse -Force </strong></p>
	<ul>
	<li>Re-open MSYS2 with the <strong>mingw64</strong> command inside the PowerShell terminal</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>src</strong> directory in your backup shoudl contain your previous work. It 
	is safe to copy this enture foler across to your new MSYS2 Profile.</p>
	<p>You will need to pull down your Hamlib repository again and/or restore any custom work 
	to folders created within the MSYS2 environment. See Step 3b below.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Deployment</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Preparation: Deploy a Virtualisation Environment</h3>
<ul>
	<p>It is recommended to deploy the JTSDK into a fresh Windows Virtual Machine. For those 
	unfamiliar with &quot;Virtual Machines&quot; and &quot;Virtualisation Technologies&quot; you shoud refer to  <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-virtualization">https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-virtualization</a> .</p>
	<p><strong> Note:</strong> Almost EVERY CPU that Runs Windows x64 these days has virtualisation support.</p>
	<p>If you have concerns please refer to <a href="https://www.technorms.com/8208/check-if-processor-supports-virtualization">https://www.technorms.com/8208/check-if-processor-supports-virtualization</a> . </p>
	<p>There are lots of virtualisation environments available. Click on the links below to 
	obtain details on how to deploy these systems:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v">Hyper-V</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2057907">VMWare Workstation</a> </li>
	<li><a href="https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2053973">VMware Player</a></li>

	<li><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Virtual Box</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Trial Virtual Machine images for Windows 10 (with Microsoft&#39;s Compiler Suite) can 
	be downloaded from <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/">https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/</a> . 
	These Virtual machines should have a lifetime of at least 30 days.</p>
</ul>
<h3>Step 1: Deploy the JTSDK64-Base-3.2.2.exe Installer and any &quot;Tools&quot; packages if they exist</h3>
<ul>
	<p><strong> Note that these instructions assumes a fresh Windows 10 Virtual Machine is used </strong></p>
	<ul>
	<li>Download and deploy the installer ( i.e. <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/JTSDK64-Base-3.2.2.exe">JTSDK-Base-3.2.2</a> ) inside a FRESH VM.</li>
	<li>Deploy any &quot;Tools&quot; Packages ( i.e. <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/JTSDK64-Tools-3.2.2.5.exe">JTSDK64-Tools-3.2.2.5</a> ) to your Base Deployment.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is recommended to use all the default settings and file locations provided by the installer.</p>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2: Launch the Installation Environment</h3>
    <h4>Special Note for Windows 11, Tools 3.2.2.5 and VC Runtimes Deployment</h4>

	<p>The tools are constantly being updated. We should work with the latest and best environment available to us.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Select <strong>2. Update MSYS2</strong> to update the MSYS2 environment. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>Note that the window may close on completion if there are updates. </p>
	<ul>
	<li>If the MSYS2 Window closes reopen it within the <strong>JTSDK64-Setup</strong> environment by typing <strong>msys2</strong> at the PowerShell environment prompt.</li>
	<li>If the update process requests that you close the open <strong>msys2</strong> terminal then close the window. Re-open the environment by typing <strong>msys2</strong> at the PowerShell environment prompt.</li>
	<li>Repeat these steps if neceessary until there are no more updates available.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Step 2c: Install Hamlib Dependencies</h4>
<ul>
<p>This step involves deploying the basic tools and compiler sets reuired to build Hamlib.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the MSYS2 Window closes reopen it within the <strong>JTSDK64-Setup</strong> environment with <strong>msys2</strong></li>
<li>Back at menu, select <strong>3. Install Hamlib Dependencies</strong> to deploy the tools needed to build Hamlib.</li>
<li>Select <strong> 4. Install msys64 GNU Compilers </strong> so that a msys64 POSIX-compliant build environment can be launched.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Step 2d: Basic Deployment Complete</h4>
<ul>
<p>Once complete you should exit the <strong>JTSDK64-Setup</strong> environment.</p> 
	<ul>
	<li>Close the <strong>JTSDK64-Setup</strong> and any MSYS2 terminal shells. </li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3: Set Up the JTSDK64-Tools Environment</h3>
<ul>
<p>These steps require you to work in the <strong>JTSDK64-Tools</strong> environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch the <strong>JTSDK64-Tools</strong> environment from the icon on your desktop.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Step 3a: (Recommended) Upgrade your Qt Deployment</h4>
<ul>
	<p>A Minimum Qt installation pegs at <a href="https://www.qt.io/download-open-source">Qt</a> at version 5.15.2. If you did not use 
	the &quot;F&quot; Full option for <a href="https://www.qt.io/download-open-source">Qt</a> deployment or you 
	want to update Qt to an experimental version such as 6.3.1 version you should do so now. 
	Note that using Qt 5.15.2 is the only Qt version that JT-ware source supports at this time.</p>
  <p>Perform the following steps:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Navigate to the Qt Deployment directory</li>
		
		<li>Run the <strong>Qt Maintenance Tool</strong> from your Qt deployment directory (i.e. <strong>C:\JTASK64-Tools\tools\Qt</strong>)</li>
	</ul>
  <p>To add Qt 6.3.1:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Add Qt 6.3.1 MinGW.</li>
		
		<li>Ensure that components Qt 6.3.1/MinGW 11.2.0 64 bit and Qt 6.3.1/Qt5 Compatability Module are added.</li>
		
		<li>Select Qt 6.3.1/All Additional Libraries .</li>
		
		<li>Add Developer and Designer Tools / MinGW 11.2.0 64-bit</li>
		
		<li>(Optional) Add the OpenSSL 1.1.1x toolkit (it helps with a WSJTX download).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>On Completion:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Adjust the maker file in <strong>x:\JTSDK64-Tools\config</strong> marker file to match the Qt version that you want to use </li>
		
		<ul>
		<li>i.e. rename <strong>qt5.15.2</strong> to <strong>qt6.3.1</strong></li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<p>There must only be ONE marker file for Qt in <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools\config</strong></p>
<p>If the system abends with a warning check the <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools\config</strong> directory and remove the unwanted item with the prefix &#39;qt&#39;</p>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4>Step 3b: Deploy Hamlib for our selected Qt Version.</h4>
<ul>
<p>In <strong>JTSDK64-Tools</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch the MSYS2 environment with: <strong>mingw64</strong></li>
<li>Type: <strong>menu</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>7. Build Hamlib - Dynamic Libraries</strong></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have difficulties packaging <a href="https://hamlib.github.io/">Hamlib</a> with <a href="https://jtdx.tech/en/">JTDX</a> and/or <a href="http://js8call.com/">JS8CALL</a> you may need to use the The <strong>build-hamlib.sh</strong> script from the MSYS2 terminal as follows:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>build-hamlib.sh -nlibusb -static</strong></li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<p>This will take time as it pulls from the master repository for Hamlib. </p>
<p>Source distribution repositories can be changed by changing the marker file in <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools\config</strong> </p>
	<ul>
	<li>Valid options are: <strong>hlmaster</strong> (default and recommended), <strong>hlw4mdb</strong>, <strong>hlg4wjs</strong> or <strong>hlnone</strong> for no default pull and update.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h4>Step 3c: Deploy Boost for our selected Qt/MinGW Version.</h4>
<ul>
<p><strong><em>THIS IS SLOW</em></strong>. There are &quot;dropins&quot; available on the Sourceforge and GitHub sites if you are lazy. Yet the best procedure is to build your own.</p>
<p>In JTSDK64-Tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type: <strong>Deploy-Boost</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Around 90 minutes later you should now have a deployment of Boost based at the recommended v1.74.0 (configurable in <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools\config\Versions.ini</strong>) that is suitable to build JT-software under your selected Qt version on your machine.</p>

<p>Precompiled drop-in packages for <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/Boost-1.74.0-MinGW-v7.3-v8.1.7z">Boost-1.74.0</a>, <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/Boost-1.77.0-MinGW-v7.3-v8.1.7z">Boost-1.77.0</a> , <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/Boost-1.78.0-MinGW-v7.3-v8.1.7z">Boost-1.78.0</a> and <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/Boost-1.79.0-MinGW-v8.1-v11.2.7z">Boost-1.79.0</a> are available at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Each “drop-in” package has folders i.e. 1.74.0-7.3 for <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> 7.3 (pre-Qt 5.15) and 1.74.0-8.1 (for post-Qt 5.15 including the 6.x.x streams). </p>
<ul>
<li>Extract the folder for the Boost version-package that you want to use into <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\boost</strong> (create the directory if it does not exist) and then remove the -7.3, -8.1 or -11.2 suffix.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Windows symbolic link will work too: i.e.: Assume that both the 1.74.0-7.3 and 1.74.0-8.1 distributions have been unpacked from <strong>Boost-1.74.0-MinGW-v7.3-v8.1.7z</strong> to <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\boost</strong> . Assume that the command shell or powershell windows are positioned at <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\boost</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cmd:<strong> mklink /D 1.74.0 1.74.0-8.1 </strong></li>
<li>PowerShell:<strong> New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path C:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\boost\boost-1.74.0 -Value C:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\boost\boost-1.74.0-8.1 </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The preference is to build your own Boost package and NOT use these ! <strong> Warning: Boost does not build 100% properly and to full capability under MinGW/MSYS2 environments that we use – yet its good enough for our purposes !</strong></p>
</ul>
<table width="*" align="center" border="1">
	<tr>
		<td class="custd">A script <strong>Reset-Boost.ps1</strong> is available to reset any failed attempts at building Boost.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br/>
<table width="*" align="center" border="1">
	<tr>
		<td class="custd">Environments should now be complete for building JT-ware</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<ul>
	<p>That seemed a lot of work. Please dissect these scripts to see what actually took place !</p>
</ul>
<h4>(Optional) Step 3d: Update Path settings so that JTDX can find DLL's that it needs.</h4>

<table width="*" align="center" border="1">
	<tr>
		<td class="custd"><strong>This may not be needed in the future.</strong> There is a packaging error with JTDX that can be overcome with this simple set of steps.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<ul>	
<p>On your Windows Destop:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Start the <em>Windows Control Panel</em> (setps assumed to be known - i.e. Start / Run / Control).</li>
		<li>Select <em>System / Advanced System Properties / Advanced / Environment Variables</em></li>
		<li>Under &quot;User variables for &lt;user&gt;&quot;, <u>double-click on &quot;path&quot;</u></li>
		<li>In the &quot;Edit environment variable&quot; dialog add the following two entries:</li>
		  <ul>
			<li>Click New ==&gt; <strong>C:\Windows\SysWOW64\downlevel </strong></li>
			<li>Click New ==&gt; <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\hamlib\qt\5.15.2\bin</strong></li>
			<li> Click Ok / Ok.</li>
		  </ul>
	  </li>
		<li>It is now advisable to reboot your system.</li>
	</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>This is only a temporary work-around. Hopefully JTDX CMakeFile scripts will be updated in a future release so these patches are no longer requried.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Step 4: Build your JT- Software</h3>
<ul>
	<p>Now you are ready to BUILD a JT-release. </p>
<p>The release-source-code pulled is for the latest JT-software release. The JT-source that you pull is configurable from <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools\config</strong>. Rename the file <strong>src-wsjtx</strong> from a default pull of WSJT-X to either <strong>src-jtdx</strong> or <strong>src-js8call</strong> if desired. </p>
<p>The &quot;major&quot; used JT-ware distributions are supported without discrimination or political comment.</p>
	<p>In JTSDK64-Tools:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Type: <strong>jtbuild</strong>      i.e. <strong>jtbuild package</strong></li>
	</ul>
<p>Options preferred are package (a Windows Installer package - the preferred &quot;clean&quot; way) and rinstall (just a static directory full of &quot;runnable&quot; files).</p>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Additional Options for Developers</h2>
<hr>
<ul>

<p>Both the <strong>jtbuild</strong> and <strong>build-hamlib-</strong> scripts now contain a number of switches that can be used to disable default features of the scripts.</p>
<p>Use the embedded <strong>help</strong> facilities to discover the currently available set of switches:</p>
<p>i.e. 1:  In The <strong>PowerShell</strong> Environment:</p>
</ul>
<div class="reducewidth">
<pre>
PS C:\JTSDK64-Tools> jtbuild -h

--------------------------------------------
 Default Build Commands
--------------------------------------------

 Usage .....: jtbuild [ OPTION ] [[ SWITCH ]]

 Examples...: jtbuild rinstall
            : jtbuild rinstall -ng

 Options:

    rconfig    Release, Config Only
    dconfig    Debug, Config Only
    rinstall   Release, Non-packaged Install
    dinstall   Debug, Non-packaged Install
    package    Release, Windows Package
    docs       Release, User Guide

 Switches:

    Switches only work if an [ OPTION ] is supplied.

    -nc        Do not run configure
    -ng        Do not check/pull source

 * To Display this message, type .....: jtbuild -h

PS C:\JTSDK64-Tools>
</pre>
</div>
<ul>
<p>i.e. 2:  In The <strong>MSYS2</strong> Environment:</p>
</ul>
<div class="reducewidth">
<pre>

---------------------------------------------------------------
 BUILD-HAMLIB - HELP
---------------------------------------------------------------

* Available Command Line Options:

  --> -h ........: Help
  --> -b/-nb ....: Process / Do not process bootstrap
  --> -c/-nc ....: Process / Do not process configure
  --> -g/-ng ....: Process / Do not pull/check source from GIT repository
  --> -libusb ...: Configure with LibUSB support
  --> -nlibusb ..: Do not configure with LibUSB support
  --> -static ...: Statically Linked Libraries built
       or ..
  --> -dynamic ..: Shared/Dynamically Linked Libraries built

* Note: You cannot select -static with -dynamic

  If using switches you may need to combine options to over-ride default build behaviour:

  i.e.: build-hamlib -nb reverts to Hamlib default STATIC build behaviour
        build-hamlib -nb -dynamic over-rides this behaviour
