<h2>JTSDK 3.4.1 Application Notes</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Direction</h3>
<ul>
<p>The <strong>JTSDK 3.4.1</strong> evolves the kits from Windows Batch Files towards Windows 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">PowerShell</a>-based scripts. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">PowerShell</a> is also supported in Mac and 
Linux environs, so common-adaptation for these purposes may occur as the kits evolve. </p>
<p>This started as an experiment to reduce maintenance (i.e. new package versions). 
The deployment environment <strong> jtsdk64-setup.ps1</strong> will always require hard-coded 
base package support. Once an environment is set up maintenance tasks are simplified.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">PowerShell</a> eclipses the capabilities of Windows Batch files. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">PowerShell</a> 
completely removes needs for capable third-party environments such as <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>.</p>
</ul>
<h3>The Version 3.2 Base Stream</h3>
<ul>
<p>The <strong>Version 3.2</strong> stream is a learning, discovery and technique refinement experiment. </p>
</ul>
<h3>Version 3.4.1</h3>
<ul>
<p>The <strong>JTSDK 3.4.1</strong> outwardly will appear similar to the <strong>JTSDK 3.2.0</strong>-stream. Yet the 
<strong>JTSDK 3.4.1</strong> has significant enhancements in that many of the key commands now accept 
switches that can make the process of developing code quicker and simpler.</p>
<p>In addition the &quot;mirroring&quot; of <strong>build-hamlib.sh</strong> and <strong>build-hamlib.sh-static</strong> has been 
broken - with <strong>build-hamlib.sh</strong> offering a number of additional command-line switches to 
aid developers.</p>
<p>The <strong>JTSDK 3.4.1</strong> provides a version of <a href="https://libusb.info/">LibUSB 1.0.27</a> that we have supplied.</p>
	</ul>

<h3>Project Status</h3>

<ul>
<p>This project is now at the <strong>Release</strong> phase of its life cycle. Primary objectives have 
been met (i.e. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">PowerShell</a> conversion, Ability to compile latest source code to 
bleeding-edge Hamlib code). </p>
<p>Future kits will be much smaller in distribution size. You will be required to 
	build libraries (i.e. <a href="https://www.boost.org/https://www.boost.org/">Boost</a>) as part of the learning process.</p>
<p>Current packaging preempts known cases of proposed licence and delivery condition changes. </p>

<p>Precompiled drop-in packages for <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/Boost-1.74.0-MinGW-v7.3-v8.1.7z">Boost-1.74.0</a>, <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/Boost-1.81.0-MinGW-v8.1-v11.2.7z">Boost-1.81.0</a>, <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/Boost-1.82.0-MinGW-v8.1-v11.2.7z">Boost-1.82.0</a> , <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/Boost-1.83.0-MinGW-v8.1-v11.2.7z">Boost-1.83.0</a>, <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/Boost-1.84.0-MinGW-v8.1-v11.2.7z">Boost-1.84.0</a>  and <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/Boost-1.85.0-MinGW-v8.1-v11.2.7z">Boost-1.85.0</a> built under Qt&#39;s <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> 8.1 and <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> 11.2 environs are available (saving 3+ hours).</p>

<h3>The Next Steps</h3>

<ul>	
<p>Version 4 of the JTSDK will involve strategic re-think. Watch the <a href="https://groups.io/g/JTSDK/messages">JTSDK Forum</a> for updates.</p>
</ul>
	
<h3>Kit Construction</h3>

<ul>
<p>Most configuration is now based on either marker files in <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools\config</strong> 
or specified package versions listed in <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools\config\Versions.ini</strong> . 
See the <a href="https://groups.io/g/JTSDK/messages">JTSDK Forum</a> and post comments (or email main contributors found there).</p>
</ul>
	
<h3>Support</h3>

<ul>
<p>Heads-up advice from developers is essential. We are not &#39;enemies&#39;; we are just 
inquisitive. <strong>Nobody asked us to do this - Nobody should have to ask in the AR community</strong>. 
Maintainers work on this to learn. We support the development of the skill base 
and hence reputation of Amateur Radio.</p>
</ul>
	
<h3>Added Support and Features</h3>

<ul>
<p>The <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/Tests/">Sourceforge Tests</a> folder  contains bleeding-edge  efforts to translate and improve 
scripts. Some past scripts may not be able to be eliminated easily or in fact be 
converted at all.</p>
<p>Support for following technologies are <strong>added/enhanced</strong> in these streams:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hamlib support for other non-JT- software packages (will occur silently???).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.qt.io/download-open-source">Qt</a>&#39;s incorporated CMAKE</li>
<li>The version of <a href="https://www.boost.org/">Boost</a> can be selected in <strong>Version.inf</strong> and will be compiled to the selected version of Qt (including its MinGW release).</li>
<li>Greater package version self-configuration - hence <strong>less maintenance required</strong>.</li>
<li>Upgrades to &quot;static&quot; apps that have no generically named latest-version sources</li>
</ul>
<p>The versions of packages supported are now able to be edited into the kit in one 
place - the <strong>Versions.ini</strong> file. This makes maintenance tasks easier.</p>
</ul>
	
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">PowerShell</a> scripts are managed to tight security rules.</p>
<p>The kits may never be able to move away from the Windows CMD processor and its &quot;Batch 
files&quot; in order to compile JT- software.</p>
<p>Operational techniques have already evolved  i.e. the need for <strong>qt-gen-tc</strong> has been 
eliminated. Some needed techniques to support &#39;familiarity&#39; also have limits. Ways that 
processes are executed may change.</p>
<p>Qt  under the MinGW compiler set needs to be deployed to build JT-ware. This means that there can be clashes with the MSYS2 utilities and compiler sets needed to build Hamlib and other libraries. Such clashes need to be resolved mostly via setting system paths in the correct sequence and/or sometimes diabling some tools that can conflict. </p>
<p>There is only a small number of us are working on this project now. More assistance is needed :-) </p>
<p>The complexity of the GIT code distribution system - initially conceived by Linus Torvalds of Linux fame - makes code and script management harder than it needs to be. We need a dedicated manager for this role that can teach us how to use this system more effectively.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Extras folder X:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\extras for additional &quot;missing&quot; DLL's</h3>
<ul>
<p>In order to overcome isssues reported a an <strong>extras</strong> folder has been included into <strong>X:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools</strong> where additional &quot;missing&quot; packaged DLL's can be placed.</strong></p>
<ul>
<p>i.e. copy missing DLL's, such as <strong>libgfortran-4.dll</strong> into this folder for recent WSJTX-builds to succeed.</p>
</ul>
<p>Packaging requirements are therefore met.</p>
<p>This option is NOT RECOMMENDED FOR LONG TERM USE. It should be used as a LAST RESORT.</p>
<p><strong>Fix the actual problem</strong> - whether it be how the libraries used are built OR it may be redundant scripted requirements from legacy code that has been re-introduced.</p>

<h3>CPACK Packaging Issues - Not Finding DLL's</h3>
<ul>
	<p><strong>Issue:</strong> Unable to package WSJTX or JTDX because of NUMEROUS DLL's reported as being missing</p>

	<p><strong>Resolution:</strong> Issue an appropriate command to find the path of necessary libraries before performing a <strong>jtbuild package </strong>command</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are using <strong>Qt 5.15.2</strong>:</li>
<ul>
<p><strong>$env:Path += "</strong>;C:\Windows\SysWOW64\downlevel;C:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\hamlib\qt\5.15.2\bin<strong>"</strong></p>
</ul>
<li>If you are using <strong>Qt 6.7.2</strong> (experimental only - Will not build JT-ware yet):</li>
<ul>
<p><strong>$env:Path += "</strong>;C:\Windows\SysWOW64\downlevel;C:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\hamlib\qt\6.7.2\bin<strong>"</strong></p>
</ul>
</ul>
	<p>These paths could also  be added to the main Windows system paths.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Control Panel/About/Advanced System Settings/Advanced/Environment Variables.</li>
		<li>Append the lines to the existing local user's path:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>For <strong>Qt 5.15.2</strong>:</li>
			<br/>
			<ul>
			<strong>C:\Windows\SysWOW64\downlevel;C:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\hamlib\qt\5.15.2\bin</strong>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<li>For <strong>Qt 6.7.2</strong> (Developmental):</li>
			<br/>
			<ul>
			<strong>C:\Windows\SysWOW64\downlevel;C:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\hamlib\qt\6.7.2\bin</strong>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		<li>Restart the build proess i.e. <strong>jtbuild package</strong></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Please refer to <a href="QU3.html">The Questions Section</a> for more detail.</p>
</ul>
<h3>Further anomalies observed when building and packaging JTDX</h3>
<ul>
<p>An error message at packaging may be displayed that does not identify a DLL or missing library.</p>
	
	<p>Try the following procedure:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Edit <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools\config\Versions.ini</strong></li>
		<li>Change key <em>unixtools=enabled</em> to <em>unixtools=disabled</em></li>
		<li>Save and exit.</li>
		<li>Close all MSYS2 and Powershell Terminals</li>
		<li>Re-launch the <strong>JTSDK64-Tools</strong> environment.</li>
		<li>Re-attempt the build.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Hamlib Requirements</h3>
 <ul>
	<p>The current release version of <strong>JS8CALL</strong> will not package if the <strong>Hamlib</strong> is built with with <strong>Dynamic libraries and LibUSB support</strong>.</p>
	<ul>
	  	<li>Execute  the following commands at the <strong>mingw64</strong> command prompt:</li>		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>build-hamlib -nlibusb -static</strong> &lt;== note the use of the extension</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Once the Hamlib build is complete, close all MSYS2 and JTSDK64-Tools Terminals and Windows.</li>
		
		<li>Open a <strong>JTSDK64-Tools</strong> Console.</li>
		<li>Build the JT-ware package with your specified option i.e.<strong> jtbuild package</strong></li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Notes for working with your own modified source</h2>
<hr/>
	<table width="*" align="center" border="1">
		<tr>
			<td class="custd">Ensure that the marker file inside <strong>x:\JTSDK64-Tools\config</strong> is named <strong>src-none</strong></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<ul>
		<p>Modify the source for your own requirements at your own peril.</p> 
		<p>Start with a GIT pull from your base repository. This should set markers appropriate for your development.</p>
		<p>Execute  the following command at the <strong>JTSDK64-Tools</strong> command prompt:</p>		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>jtbuild package -ng</strong>   <== Does not pull from a GIT Repository</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The "source marker" in <strong>x:\JTSDK64-Tools\config</strong> can also be renamed to <strong>hl-none</strong> for a more permanent solution.</p>		
		<p>It is highly recommended that you customise the<strong> jtbuild.ps1</strong> script in <strong>x:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\scripts</strong> for your own purpose and set this command as a PowerShell <em><strong>alias</strong></em> so that you do not continuously over-write your work.</p>
		<p>These kits are focussed on users that want to build their own JT-ware releases based on the latest code available.<br>
		<br>
		Details on how to do this are not provided in this documentation as one should only be tinkering with JT-ware source code if one knows how to work with both the source code and how to modify the PowerShell scripts for their needs.</p>
		<p>Ensure that you comply with the source release requirements and terms for <strong>WSJT-X</strong> source usage - again at your own peril.</p>
		<p>If uncertain as to what these requirements are then please ask in the <strong>WSJT-X Forum</strong>.</p>
