	<h2>JTSDK 3.4.1 Questions and Suggestions for Resolving for Common Issues</h2>
	<hr>
	<h3>What has happened to the original JTSDK creator?</h3>
    <ul>
		<p><a href="https://github.com/KI7MT">Greg Beam KI7MT</a> is still around and with us on the JTSDK Forum at <a href="https://groups.io/g/JTSDK">jtsdk@groups.io</a>. People's interests change; you will see from Greg's posts that he has evolved past active JTSDK development. 
		</p><p>We cannot thank Greg more highly for his past and ongoing work - especially as a mentor at this point in time.</p>
	<p>No politics here. This is not a push out or push aside. The 'hamlibdk' group as entities seek no glory nor recognition. Contributors just evolved work where Greg left off as the need was there for this to occur.</p>
<p>Other developers have gone silent (but may still be around in the background) due to some of the nastiness in our environment.&nbsp;</p>
</ul>
	<h3>Where can I ask question ?</h3>
    <ul>
	  <p>The original JTSDK Forum <a href="https://groups.io/g/JTSDK">jtsdk@groups.io</a> is used as the primary communication point for this project.</p>
		<p>Have no hesitations posting questions to there. If you are unable to post then email main contributors in that forum directly.</p>
	</ul>
	<h3>Windows 11: Deployments grind to a halt</h3>
    <ul>
  	<p>UnderWindows 11 sometimes users have observed that the tasks appear to grind to a halt.</p>
		<p>We have no answers to why this happens.</p>
		<p>Press ENTER in the "stalled" Window and all seems to come back to life..</p>
	</ul>
	<h3>What happens if I receive a PowerShell security warning? Is it safe to run the PowerShell Scripts?</h3>
    <ul>
	<p>You may receive the following <strong>security notification</strong>:</p>
	</ul>
<div class="reducewidth"> <pre>
Execution Policy Change
The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing 
the execution policy might expose you to the security risks described in the 
about_Execution_Policies help topic at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. 
Do you want to change the execution policy?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"):
</pre>
	</div>
	<ul>
	<p>It is safe to select <strong>Y</strong>. These scripts are not any processor flaw tests. Remember
	that developing these scripts is also a learning exercise for the Development Team.</p>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>How does the SDK use PowerShell? Why does the SDK need to use PowerShell when previous kits used CMD scripts?</h3>
	
	<ul>
	<p>The second part first: PowerShell creates a HIGHLY EXTENSIBLE scripted environment. The PowerShell environment is much more powerful and offers facilities that vastly eclipse capabilities of the old CMD.EXE processor and its scripts. Many tasks became onerous and were pushing the boundaries of what CMD.EXE-capable scripts could perform. Some tasks (such as extracting version information from the <strong>cmake</strong> files) became near impossible with CMD.EXE scripts. Therefore the PowerShell 'universal' scripting environment - provided by Microsoft STANDARD with Windows - was selected as the investigation tool for this project.</p>
	<p>The basic concept of supporting <strong>Windows Environment Variables</strong> through <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">PowerShell</a> 
	<strong>$env:<env-var></strong> facilities ease access into CMake, QMake and the MinGW compilers - components that will always remain a cornerstone concepts.</p>
	</ul>
	
<h3>How do I upgrade existing JTSDK deployments?</h3>
	<ul>
	<p>The <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/JTSDK64-3.4.1.exe">JTSDK64-3.4.1</a> should be able to be installed over the top of previous kits - yet it is 
	highly recommended that you start from scratch.</p>
	<p><strong> It is highly recommended that kits are deployed into Virtual machines (see <a href="DG3.html">Installation</a> section).</strong> </p>
	<p>It is highly recommended that a new, fresh deployment be considered with each new base package release.</p>
	<p>You can keep old deployment(s) by closing all open environment windows and renaming the deployment folder (i.e. <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools</strong> to <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools-Old</strong>) </p>
	<p>If you need to revert back to your old deployment then all you need do is rename that folder back to its original filename (i.e. <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools-Old</strong> back to <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools</strong>) </p>
	</ul>
	
<h3>How do I update the JTSDK?</h3>
	
	<ul>
	<p>Maintenance updates will be applied in the form of &quot;Tools&quot; packages. These packages 
	are designed to be deployed to existing &quot;Base&quot; packages.</p>
	</ul>
	
<h4>Where do I get and how do I apply 'Update'/'Patch'&nbsp; packages?</h4>

	<ul>
	  <p><strong></strong>Update/Patch&nbsp; packages can be downloaded from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-4.0-Stream/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-4.0-Stream/</a> .</p>
	<p><em>These steps assume that you have a deployed base environment</em></p>
	<ul>
	<li>Download any Update/Patch packages if they exist ( i.e. packages with a "U" in the filename) from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-4.0-Stream/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-4.0-Stream/</a>. </li>
	<li>Deploy the tools package to your JTSDK64 install directory.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Updates may apply to the MSYS2 environment. Therefore the &quot;profile&quot; directory for 
	MSYS2 should be deleted and re-created.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>(Optional) Copy any folders stored under <strong>x:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\msys64\home</strong> to a backup location. This should enable you to access previous work.</li>
		
		<li>Close any open MSYS2 environment terminal(s).</li>
		
		<li>Perform the system upgrade.</li>
		
		<li>Delete folders that exist under <strong>x:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\msys64\home</strong>.</li>
	  
		<ul>
			<li>i.e: PowerShell: <strong> Remove-Item &quot;C:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\msys64\home*&quot; -Recurse -Force </strong></li>
		</ul>
		
		<li>Re-open MSYS2 with the <strong>msys2</strong> command for maintenance or <strong>mingw64</strong> for development work inside the PowerShell terminal</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>src</strong> directory in your backup should contain your previous work. It is safe to copy this enture folder across to your new MSYS2 Profile.</p>
	<p>You will need to pull down your Hamlib repository again and/or restore any custom work 
	to folders created within the MSYS2 environment. See Step 3b below.</p>
	</ul>

<h2>Issues and Potential Work Arounds</h2>

<ul>
	<p>Environments have become EXTREMELY COMPLEX. What can work on one machine may not work on another.</p>
	<p>These notes may assist you getting around some of the issues that have been observed.</p>

<h3>VC 2022 Runtimes Deployment Error during <strong>postinstall</strong></h4>   

    <ul>
    <p>When you start up the <em>JTSDK64-Setup</em> environment in <strong>Windows 11</strong> you may notice the following:</p>
    </ul>
	<div class="reducewidth">
<pre>

        <p>In the above example it is shown that the VC 2022 Runtimes are not deployed.</p>
        <p>When you run <strong>postinstall</strong> with deployment of VC 2022 Runtimes selected for deployment the following error occurs:</p>

</pre> </div>
    <ul>    
        <p>This is because LATER versions of the VC Runtimes may be reployed in your Windows 11 deployment</p>
        <p>The postinstall script has difficulty handling and detecting later versions of the VC runtimes.</p>
        <p>This can be resolved with the following simple procedure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Restart the deployment.</li>
            <li>Ignore the deployment of The VC 2022 runtimes (i.e. select 'N') if you experience this error.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
<h3>Wrong Qt deployment settings</h3>
<ul> 
<p>By far the most common issue observed has occurred when end users have performed default deploys of&nbsp; <strong>Qt 5.12.12</strong> under past kits. <strong>Qt 5.12.x</strong> is no longer supported.</p>
<p><strong>Qt 5.15.2</strong> is the default version of Qt used for development.</p>

<p>Most development and testing has been performed with <strong>Qt 5.15.2</strong> and its <strong>MinGW 8.1</strong> environment.</p>
<table width="*" align="center" border="1">
		<tr>
			<td class="custd"><strong>All libraries and software including Boost, Hamlib and the JT-ware should be rebuilt if not using <strong>Qt 5.15.2</strong>.</strong></td>
		</tr>
	</table>

<p>The marker file to set the version of Qt used is found in <strong>x:\JTSDK64-Tools\config</strong> i.e. <strong>qt5.15.2</strong> (as default).</p>
<p>Rename that file as appropriate to match the version of Qt that is deployed or that you want to use i.e. from <strong>qt5.15.2</strong> to <strong>qt6.7.2&nbsp; </strong>.&nbsp;</p>
</ul>
<h3>Qt 5.15.2 Not Being Deployed</h3>
<ul> 
<p>As of March 2024 it has been observed that Qt 5.15.2 is no longer available from "Mainstream" installer sources</p>
<table width="*" align="center" border="1">
		<tr>
			<td class="custd"><strong>Qt 5.15.2 is still available from "Archive" ast the time of writing. This means that Qt must be deployed manually from "Archive" Repositories</strong></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
<p>It is now recommended that one performs a "Full" deployment of Qt at install time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should properly deploy <strong>Qt 6.7.2</strong> along with the <strong>Qt Maintenance Tool</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the JTSDK is deployed you can then add Qt 5.15.2 MANUALLY from Archive.&nbsp;</p>
<table width="*" align="center" border="1">
		<tr>
			<td class="custd"><strong>See the guide <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/JTware-Deployment/Deploying-Archived-Versions-of-Qt-via-Maintenance-Tool.docx">https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/JTware-Deployment/Deploying-Archived-Versions-of-Qt-via-Maintenance-Tool.docx</a> for latest instructions</strong></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</ul>
<h3>Issues observed when trying to build software with Qt 6.7.2 deployments</h3>
<ul>
  <p><strong>Qt 6</strong> is not currently supported by the JT-ware developers. Current source code of all known JT-ware forks at the time that this document was written will not compile under <strong>Qt 6</strong>.</p>
	<p>JT-ware developers are researching Qt 6-compatible code conversion.&nbsp;</p>
</ul>
<h3>Issues observed when trying to perform a Full Deployment: Qt 5 and/or Qt 6  does not Deploy</h3>
<table width="*" align="center" border="1">
		<tr>
			<td class="custd"><strong>As Qt deployment is now manual - no longer scripted - much of this section is now legacy information</strong></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
<ul>
  <p><strong>JTSDK 2.3.2</strong> with <strong>Tools 3.2.3.3</strong> Has the capability to deploy two "streams" of Qt kit:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong> Default Deployment</strong>: deploys <strong>Qt Version 5.15.2</strong>. This is not likely to change - but at some stage it may be withdrawn from release by the Qt maintainers. When this occurs our kit will not be able to find these files; it will not install.</li>
  <li><strong>Full Deployment</strong>: deploys <strong>both Qt versions 5.15.2 and Qt 6.7.2</strong> at the time that this document was written. If one or either of these versions cannot be found then these kits will not be installed.</li>
  </ul>
<p>This kit by default deploys the <a href="https://www.qt.io/download-open-source">Qt SDK For Open Source Release</a>. This is also compliant with the basic beliefs, method and release licensing terms for WSJTX.</p>
  <p>These Qt deployment repositories are stored in <a href="https://download.qt.io/static/mirrorlist/">geo-assigned download repositories</a>. Each repository ONLY MAKES THE LATEST DOWNLOAD RELEASE STREAMS AVAILABLE to the Qt installer.</p>
  <p>The Qt maintainers may at some stage in the future bump the versions available i.e. From <strong>6.7.2</strong> to&nbsp; <strong>6.7.2</strong> (as an example).&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong><u>Our kit has a way of dealing with this:</u></strong></p>
  <p>Refer to the file <strong>x:\JTSDK64-Tools\config\Versions.ini</strong>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>There are two keys that (at the time of writing) can br found at the bottom of the file:</p>
<div class="reducewidth">
<pre>
File: x:\JTSDK64-Tools\config\Versions.ini
...
#future enhancement to set Qt version
qt5v=5.15.2
qt6v=6.7.2
</pre>
	</div>
	<ul>
	<li>Edit the appropriate key (most likely <em>qt6v</em>) to point to the currently distributable Qt version.</li>
	<li>Save your new <strong>Versions.ini</strong> file.</li>
	<li>Close any open environment terminals (Most likely to be a <strong>JTSDK64-Setup</strong> terminal).</li>
	<li>Restart the appropriate environment terminal. Use the <strong>postinstall</strong> script to attempt a fresh scripted deployment of Qt.</li>
	
	</ul>
</ul>
		
<h3>JT-ware compile error around code that uses the Resource Compilers</h3>
<ul> 
<p>Many users have observed a compiler error (especially with JTDX) at around the 60% mark that relates to the Resource Compiler.</p>
</ul>
	<div class="reducewidth">

		<li>Edit <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools\config\Versions.ini</strong></li>
		<li>Change key <em>unixtools=enabled</em> to <em>unixtools=disabled</em></li>
		<li>Save and exit.</li>
		<li>Close all MSYS2 and Powershell Terminals</li>
		<li>Re-launch the <strong>JTSDK64-Tools</strong> environment.</li>
		<li>Re-attempt the build.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If the build succeeds then it is more than likely that SOMEHOW a MSYS2/mingw64 etc. tool is conflicting.</p>

	<p>At this point you should review changes made to your environment and  reset the <em>unixtools</em> key to <em>unixtools=enabled </em>. </p>
	<p>Should all self-diagnosis attempts fail then seek further advice at the  <a href="https://groups.io/g/JTSDK">JTSDK Forum</a>.</p>
</ul>
<h3>Packaging Issues: Support for an "extras" folder</h3>
<ul>
<p><strong>In order to overcome several issues listed above an extras folder has been included into X:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools where additional &quot;missing&quot; packaged DLL's can be placed.</strong></p>
<ul>
<p>i.e. copy missing DLL's, such as <strong>libgfortran-4.dll</strong> into this folder for recent WSJTX-builds to succeed.</p>
</ul>
<p>Packaging requirements are therefore met.</p>
<p>This option is NOT RECOMMENDED FOR LONG TERM USE. It should be used as a LAST RESORT.</p>
<p>Fix the actual problem - whether it be how the libraries used are built OR it may be redundant scripted requirements from legacy code that has been re-introduced.</p>
</ul>
