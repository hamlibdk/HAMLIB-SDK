	<h3>What is this kit for?</h3>
	<ul>
		<p>The <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/">HAMLIB SDK</a> [ currently badged as the <strong>JTSDK</strong> ] is a collection of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/windows">Microsoft Windows</a>-based software that has been packaged to support the development of <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib/">Hamlib</a> and Windows software that uses Hamlib.</p>
		<p>The scripts and packages provided assist with the construction of <a href="https://www.qt.io/download-open-source#section-2>Qt</a>-based environment are provided that enable <a href=" https: physics.princeton.edu pulsar k1jt wsjtx.html>WSJT-X</a> and derivatives <a href="https://jtdx.tech/en/">JTDX</a> and <a href="http://js8call.com/">JS8CALL</a> - collectively referred to as <strong>JT-ware</strong>.</p>
		<p>Most will just need the latest developer-built library snapshots found at <a href="https://n0nb.users.sourceforge.net/">https://n0nb.users.sourceforge.net/</a>. This kit is for those who want to go further with their learning.</p>
		<p>Work on Hamlib is very dynamic. The kit permits up-to-the-second changes in <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib/">Hamlib</a> source to be compiled into to released JT-ware source, thus offering end users the opportunity to compile a JT-ware package that better supports their radio and/or other hardware. It takes pressure off JT-ware developers as many end-user issues can often be traced to small glitches in the very dynamic Hamlib suite.</p>
		<p>By empowering end users with the ability to easily and simply compile and examine the Open Source software it increases the general skill base and reputation of the Amateur Radio community at-large.</p>
	</ul>
	<h3>How is the kit constructed?</h3>
	<ul>
		<p>The kit is based around the <a href="https://www.qt.io/download-open-source#section-2">Qt for Open Source Development</a> , <a href="https://www.msys2.org/">MSYS2</a> and <a href="https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell">PowerShell</a> environments supported through a rich set of easily accessible environment variables.</p>
		<p>Where possible kit components are pulled from their distribution repositories. As the configuration of some resources becomes excessively complex when they are pulled from source some elements of the kit have been prepackaged i.e. Ruby and MSYS2. Some libraries are still prepackaged. As kits evolve users will be required to build more of their own libraries from source.</p>
		
	</ul>
	<h3>What are the charges for and legalities of using this kit?</h3>
	<ul>
	  	<p>Users should not incur any charges for using software packaged in this toolset if each tool is used according to their promoted licence terms. At no time should users ever be asked to pay for this kit.</p>
		<p>This package has been compiled in good faith to support research and academic learning.</p>
		<p>The concepts of <a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source Software</a> are heavily supported by this project.</p>
		<p>As a tool this is fit for no purpose and therefore cannot offer warranties. You use this resource at your own risk.</p>	
		<p>Refer to the licenses for each supplied component. Ensure that you comply with their requirements.</p>
		<p>Where practical this kit supports WWW concepts with software being pulled from distribution repositories. If anyone feels that their IP has been violated then please contact the project immediately. </p>
	</ul>
	<h3>Ancestry</h3>
	<ul>
		<p>These kits evolve and continue work and techniques first developed by <a href="https://github.com/KI7MT">Greg Beam KI7MT</a> and retains its name <strong>JTSDK</strong> to respect his fine work and techniques.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Future kits as they evolve into supporting software that is not considered <strong>JT-ware</strong> and may revert to the nomenclature <strong>HAMLIB SDK</strong>.</p>
<p>This (and future work) must acknowledge <a href="https://github.com/KI7MT">Greg Beam KI7MT</a>'s' work and Copyright. Subsequent work based off these resources must also repect the Academic Property, Intellectual Property and Copyright of current Hamlib SDK Developers (Termed "hamlibdk"). </p>
	</ul>
	<h3>How can I help?</h3>
	<ul>
		<p>Lots more documentation is planned to be released here. Watch this space. [ Please volunteer to make this terrible site better! ]</p>
		<p>Assistance is often called for and is always appreciated. Please refer to the base contact site <a href="https://groups.io/g/JTSDK">jtsdk@groups.io</a>.</p>
