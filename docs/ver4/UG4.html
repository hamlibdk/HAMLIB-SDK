<h2>JTSDK 4.0 User's Guide</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Direction</h3>
<ul>
	<p>The <strong>JTSDK 4.0</strong> evolves the kits from Windows Batch Files towards Windows 
	<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">PowerShell</a>-based scripts. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">PowerShell</a> is also supported in Mac and 
	Linux environs, so common-adaptation for these purposes may occur as the kits evolve. </p>
	<p>This started as an experiment to reduce maintenance (i.e. new package versions). 
	The deployment environment <strong> jtsdk64-setup.ps1</strong> will always require hard-coded 
	base package support. Once an environment is set up maintenance tasks are simplified.</p>
	<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">PowerShell</a> eclipses the capabilities of Windows Batch files. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">PowerShell</a> 
	completely removes needs for capable third-party environments such as <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>.</p>
</ul>
<h3>The Parent: Version 3.2 Base Stream</h3>
<ul>
	<p>The parent <strong>Version 3.2</strong> stream is a learning, discovery and technique refinement experiment. Subsequent versions are an evolution from this.</p>
</ul>
<h3>Version 4.0.0</h3>
<ul>
	<p>The <strong>JTSDK 4.0.0</strong> outwardly will appear similar to previous&nbsp;<strong>JTSDK Version 3</strong>-stream releases. Yet the <strong>JTSDK 4.0.0</strong> has significant updates and enhancements in that many of the key commands now accept 
	  switches that can make the process of developing code quicker and simpler.</p>
	<p>The <strong>JTSDK 4.0.0 </strong> also moves away from <strong>PowerShell Windows 5.1</strong> (The default MS-Windows-supplied version - also referred to as "PowerShell Core") to more contemporary release versions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>JTSDK 4.0.0</strong> solves a long standing issue with <a href="https://libusb.info/">LibUSB</a>  support - that up until now has been 
	disabled. Most changes in this preview incorporate enhancements to the MSYS2 environment 
	to better support the <a href="https://libusb.info/">LibUSB</a>  with Hamlib.</p>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
	<p><strong>The project needs contributors - especially with better colour tastes - to write better documentation than what can be found here !!!</strong></p>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3>Project Status</h3>
<ul>
	<p>This project is now at the <strong>development</strong> phase of its life cycle. Primary objectives have 
	been met (i.e. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">PowerShell</a> conversion, Ability to compile latest source code to bleeding-edge Hamlib code) under the <strong>JTSDK 3.4-stream</strong>. </p>
  	<p>Current packaging methods also preempts known cases of proposed licence and delivery condition changes. </p>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
	<p>The recommended mainstream development environments are <a href="https://www.qt.io/download-open-source">Qt 5.15.2</a> and <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.4-Stream/Boost-1.85.0-MinGW-v8.1.7z">Boost-1.85.0</a> working with <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MSYS2 MinGW</a> 8.1 - as supplied in the Base Kit. These documents will detail <a href="https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_85_0.html">Boost 1.85.0</a> deployments.</p>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Kit Construction</h3>
<ul>
	<p>Most configuration is now based on either marker files in <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools\config</strong> 
	or specified package versions listed in <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools\config\Versions.ini</strong> . 
	See the <a href="https://groups.io/g/JTSDK/messages">JTSDK Forum</a> and post comments (or email main contributors found there).</p>
	</ul>
<h3>Support</h3>
<ul>													
	<p>Heads-up advice from developers is essential. We are not &#39;enemies&#39;; we are just 
	inquisitive. <strong>Nobody asked us to do this - Nobody should have to ask in the AR community</strong>. 
	Maintainers work on this to learn. We support the development of the skill base 
	and hence reputation of Amateur Radio.</p>
</ul>
<h3>Added Support and Features</h3>
<ul>
	<p>The <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-4.0-Stream/Tests/">Tests</a> folder  contains bleeding-edge  efforts to translate and improve 
	scripts. Some past scripts may not be able to be eliminated easily or in fact be 
	converted at all.</p>
	<p>Support for following technologies are <strong>added/enhanced</strong> in these streams:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Hamlib support for other non-JT- software packages (will occur silently???).</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.qt.io/download-open-source">Qt</a>&#39;s incorporated CMAKE</li>
	<li>The version of <a href="https://www.boost.org/">Boost</a> can be selected in <strong>Version.inf</strong> and will be compiled to the selected version of Qt (including its MinGW release).</li>
	<li>Greater package version self-configuration - hence <strong>less maintenance required</strong>.</li>
	<li>Upgrades to &quot;static&quot; apps that have no generically named latest-version sources</li>
</ul>
<p>The versions of packages supported are now able to be edited into the kit in one 
place - the <strong>Versions.ini</strong> file. This makes maintenance tasks easier.</p>
</ul>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ul>
	<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">PowerShell</a> scripts are managed to tight security rules. See the next section.</p>
	<p>The kits may never be able to move away from the Windows CMD processor and its &quot;Batch 
	files&quot; in order to compile JT- software.</p>
	<p>Operational techniques have already evolved  i.e. the need for <strong>qt-gen-tc</strong> has been 
	eliminated. Some needed techniques to support &#39;familiarity&#39; also have limits. Ways that 
	processes are executed may change.</p>
</ul>

<h2>PowerShell Security Warnings</h2>	
<hr>
<ul>
	<p>You may receive the following <strong>security notification</strong>:</p>
</ul>
<div class="reducewidth">
<pre>
Execution Policy Change
The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing 
the execution policy might expose you to the security risks described in the 
about_Execution_Policies help topic at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. 
Do you want to change the execution policy?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"):
</pre>
</div>
<ul>
	<p>It is safe to select <strong>Y</strong>. These scripts are not any processor flaw tests. Remember
	that developing these scripts is also a learning exercise for the Development Team.</p>
</ul>
<h3>Windows Environment Variables</h3>
<ul>
	<p>The basic concept of supporting <strong>Windows Environment Variables</strong> through <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">PowerShell</a> <strong>$env:<env-var></strong> facilities that ease access into CMake, QMake and the MinGW compilers - components that will always remain a cornerstone concepts.</p>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Upgrades</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
	<p>The <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-4.0-Stream/JTSDK64-4.0.0.exe">JTSDK64-4.0.0</a> should <strong>NOT BE DEPLOYED</strong>over the top of previous kits. It is <b>highly recommended that you start deployments from scratch</b>. </p>
	<p><strong> It is highly recommended that kits are deployed into Virtual machines (see &quot;Deployment&quot; section).</strong> </p>
	<p>You can keep old deployment(s) by closing all open environment windows and renaming the deployment folder (i.e. <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools</strong> to <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools-Old</strong>) </p>
	<p>If you need to revert back to your old deployment then all you need do is rename that folder back to its original filename (i.e. <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools-Old</strong> back to <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools</strong>) </p>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Maintenance Updates</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
  <p>Maintenance updates will be applied in the form of &quot;Update" packages. There is no current update package available. The first update to the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-4.0-Stream/JTSDK64-4.0.0.exe">JTSDK64-4.0.0</a> would be <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-4.0-Stream/JTSDK64-4.0.0-U1.exe">JTSDK64-4.0.0-U1.exe</a> .&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>Note</strong>: Maintainers are no longer supporting the "Base" and "Tools&quot; nomenclature.</p>
</ul>
<table width="*" align="center" border="1">
<tr>
	<td class="custd"><strong>It is ESSENTIAL that any available update packages be applied to a deployment.</strong></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p></p>
<ul>
	<p>You do not need to apply previous update packages. Just deploy the latest update package that is available as it contains all previous updates for that stream.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<p><em>These steps assume that you have a deployed base environment</em></p>
	<ul>
	<li>Download any &quot;Update&quot; packages from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-4.0-Stream/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-4.0-Stream/</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> &nbsp; There is no current update package.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Deploy the tools package to your JTSDK install directory (typically <strong>X:\JTSDK64-Tools</strong>).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Updates may apply to the MSYS2 environment. Therefore the &quot;profile&quot; directory for 
	MSYS2 must be deleted and re-created.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Copy any folders stored under <strong>x:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\msys64\home</strong> to a backup location. This should enable you to access previous work.</li>
	<li>Close any open MSYS2 environment terminal(s).</li>
	<li>Perform the system upgrade.</li>
	<li>Delete folders that exist under <strong>x:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\msys64\home</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>i.e: PowerShell: <strong> Remove-Item &quot;C:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\msys64\home*&quot; -Recurse -Force </strong></p>
	<ul>
	<li>Re-open MSYS2 with the <strong>mingw64</strong> command inside the PowerShell terminal</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>src</strong> directory in your backup shoudl contain your previous work. It 
	is safe to copy this enture foler across to your new MSYS2 Profile.</p>
	<p>You will need to pull down your Hamlib repository again and/or restore any custom work 
	to folders created within the MSYS2 environment. See Step 3b below.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Deployment</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Preparation: Deploy a Virtualisation Environment</h3>

<ul>
	<p>It is recommended to deploy the JTSDK into a fresh Windows Virtual Machine. For those 
	unfamiliar with &quot;Virtual Machines&quot; and &quot;Virtualisation Technologies&quot; you shoud refer to  <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-virtualization">https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-virtualization</a> .</p>
	<p><strong> Note:</strong> Almost EVERY CPU that Runs Windows x64 these days has virtualisation support.</p>
	<p>If you have concerns please refer to <a href="https://www.technorms.com/8208/check-if-processor-supports-virtualization">https://www.technorms.com/8208/check-if-processor-supports-virtualization</a> . </p>
	<p>There are lots of virtualisation environments available. Click on the links below to 
	obtain details on how to deploy these systems:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v">Hyper-V</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2057907">VMWare Workstation</a> </li>
	<li><a href="https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2053973">VMware Player</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Virtual Box</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Trial Virtual Machine images for Windows 10 (with Microsoft&#39;s Compiler Suite) can 
	be downloaded from <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/">https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines</a>.</p>
	<p>These Virtual machines should have a lifetime of at least 30 days.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Pre-Requisite: Ensure that the latest WSJT-X and/or JT-ware Release is deployed.</h3>
    <ul>
      <p>Due to changes within CMake from version 3.28.0 onwards, it may be necessary to have a current deployment of WSJT-X and/or your JT-ware variant that you are working on deployed and <b>IN THE SEAERCH PATH</b>.</p>
      <p>Obtain a current release version of your product from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>WSJTX: <a href="https://wsjt.sourceforge.io/wsjtx.html">https://wsjt.sourceforge.io/wsjtx.html</a></li>
        <li>JTDX: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jtdx/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/jtdx/</a></li>
        <li>JS8Call: <a href="http://js8call.com/">http://js8call.com/</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Install the base package so that it can be found in the Windows search path.</p>
    </ul>
    <h3></h3>
	<h3>Step 1: Deploy the JTSDK64-4.0.0.exe Installer and the latest Update package</h3>

	<ul>
	  <p><strong> Note that these instructions assumes a fresh Windows 11 Virtual Machine is used. </strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Download and deploy the installer <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-4.0-Stream/JTSDK64-4.0.0.exe">JTSDK64-4.0.0</a> inside a FRESH VM.</li>	
			<li>Deploy the latest Update Package (if available). i.e. <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-4.0-Stream/JTSDK64-4.0.0-U1.exe">JTSDK64-4.0.0-U1</a> would be the first package (if available).</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<table width="*" align="center" border="1">
		<tr>
			<td class="custd">The latest "Tools" package (if available) can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-4.0-Stream/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-4.0-Stream/</a> .</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
		<p></p>
	<ul>
		<p>It is recommended to use all the default settings and file locations provided by the installer.</p>
	</ul>

<h3>Step 2: Launch the Installation Environment</h3>

<h4>Preparation: Disable Antivirus Real Time Scanning</h4>   

    <ul>
    <p>It is recommended that you disable real-time scanning for your Antivirus program. This can significantly slow down deployment.</p>
	<p>As users will have many varied solutions (Including the most common option being Windows Antivirus) the steps to do this will not be documented here.</p>
    </ul>	
		
		
<h4>Special Note for Windows 11, Update Packages and VC Runtimes Deployment</h4>   

    <ul>
    <p>When you start up the <em>JTSDK64-Setup</em> environment in <strong>Windows 11</strong> you may notice the following:</p>

	<h4>(Optional) Step 3a: Upgrade your Qt Deployment</h4>
	<ul> 
<p>As of March 2024 it has been observed that <strong>Qt 5.15.2</strong> is no longer available from "Mainstream" installer sources</p>
<table width="*" align="center" border="1">
		<tr>
			<td class="custd"><strong>Qt 5.15.2 is still available from "Archive" ast the time of writing. This means that Qt must be deployed manually from "Archive" Repositories</strong></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
<p>By this stage you should already have Qt deployed</p>
<p>Yoiu can add additional kits such as <strong>Qt 6.7.2</strong> along with its <strong>MinGW 13.1.0</strong> components and the <strong>Qt Maintenance Tool</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<table width="*" align="center" border="1">
		<tr>
			<td class="custd"><strong>See the guide <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/JTware-Deployment/Deploying-Archived-Versions-of-Qt-via-Maintenance-Tool.docx">https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/JTware-Deployment/Deploying-Archived-Versions-of-Qt-via-Maintenance-Tool.docx</a> for latest instructions</strong></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</ul>
		
	
	  <p><strong>Example: Adding additional Qt Kits</strong></p>
	<ul>
	  <p>Perform the following steps:</p>
		<ul>
		  	<li>Navigate to the Qt Deployment directory</li>
			
			<li>Run the <strong>Qt Maintenance Tool</strong> from your Qt deployment directory (i.e. <strong>C:\JTSK64-Tools\tools\Qt</strong>)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To add <strong>Qt 6.7.2</strong> (as an example):</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Add <strong>Qt 6.7.2</strong> MinGW. [ Note that the package is MinGW 13.1.0 64-bit ]</li>
			
			<li>Ensure that components <strong>Qt 6.7.2</strong>/<strong>MinGW 13.1.0 64 bit</strong> and <strong>Qt 6.7.2 Qt5 Compatability Module</strong> are added.</li>
			
			<li>Select <strong>Qt 6.7.2</strong>/All Additional Libraries .</li>
			
			<li>Add Developer and Designer Tools / MinGW 13.1.0 64-bit</li>
			
		  <li>(Optional) Add the OpenSSL 1.1.1x toolkit (it helps with a WSJTX component downloads). <strong>Note:</strong> This may not be available now. An Archived version of the kit is available <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.4-Stream/Qt-Deprecated-OpenSSL-1.1.1q_x86_x64.zip">here</a>.</li>
			<li>(Optional) Add the OpenSSL 3.x.x toolkit (for future capabilities).</li>
        </ul>
	  <p>On Completion:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Adjust the maker file in <strong>x:\JTSDK64-Tools\config</strong> marker file to match the Qt version that you want to use </li>
			
			<ul>
			<li>i.e. rename <strong>qt5.15.2</strong> to <strong>qt6.7.2</strong></li>

<h4>Step 3b: Deploy Hamlib</h4>
	
	<ul>
		<p>In <strong>JTSDK64-Tools</strong>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Launch the MSYS2 environment with: <strong>mingw64</strong></li>
			
			<li>Type: <strong>menu</strong></li>
			
			<li>Select <strong>7. Build Hamlib - Dynamic Libraries</strong></li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have difficulties packaging <a href="https://hamlib.github.io/">Hamlib</a> with <a href="https://jtdx.tech/en/">JTDX</a> and/or <a href="http://js8call.com/">JS8CALL</a> you may need to use the The <strong>build-hamlib.sh</strong> script from the MSYS2 terminal as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>build-hamlib.sh -nlibusb -dynamic</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<p>This will take time as it pulls from the master repository for Hamlib. </p>

		<p>Source distribution repositories can be changed by changing the marker file in <strong>x:\JTSDK64-Tools\config</strong> </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Valid options are: <strong>hlmaster</strong> (default and recommended), <strong>hlw4mdb</strong>, <strong>hlg4wjs</strong> or <strong>hlnone</strong> for no default pull and update.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	
<h4>Step 3c: Deploy Boost for our selected Qt/MinGW Version.</h4>

	</ul>
	<p>Extract the folder for the Boost version-package that you want to use into <strong>x:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\boost</strong> (create the directory if it does not exist) and then remove the  -8.1 or -11.2 suffix ! </p>
		<p>A Windows symbolic link will also work with a drop-in package. Refer to the example below:</p> 
		<ul>
		
		<li>Assume that both the <strong>1.85.0-8.1</strong> and <strong>1.85.0-11.2</strong> distributions have been unpacked from <strong><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/Boost-1.85.0-MinGW-v8.1-v11.2.7z">Boost-1.85.0-MinGW-v8.1-v11.2.7z</a></strong> to <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\boost</strong> .</li> 
		
			<li>The <strong>Command Shell</strong> or <strong>PowerShell</strong> terminals must be positioned at <strong>x:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\boost</strong></li>
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>cd x:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\boost</strong></li>
				
			</ul>
			<li>Execute the command that is most appropriate for your terminal environment. Examples are shown below:</li>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Command Shell (CMD):<strong> mklink /D 1.85.0 1.85.0-8.1 </strong></li>
				
				<li>PowerShell:<strong> New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path C:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\boost\boost-1.85.0 -Value C:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\boost\boost-1.85.0-8.1 </strong></li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> The preference is to build your own Boost package and NOT use these "dropins".</p>

<h4>Step 3d: Deal with JT-ware packaging issues </h4>

<table width="*" align="center" border="1">
	<tr>
		<td class="custd"><strong>There are build errors at the final packaging stage that may arise that can be overcome with this simple set of steps.</strong>.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<ul>
<p><strong>General JT-ware Packaging Issues: Support for an "extras" folder</strong></p>
<ul>
<p>In order to overcome several issues <strong>extras</strong> folder has been included into <strong>X:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools</strong> where additional &quot;missing&quot; packaged DLL's can be placed.</p>
<ul>
<p>i.e. copy missing DLL's, such as <strong>libgfortran-4.dll</strong> into this folder for recent WSJTX-builds to succeed.</p>
</ul>
<p>Packaging requirements are therefore met.</p>
<p>This option is NOT RECOMMENDED FOR LONG TERM USE. It should be used as a LAST RESORT.</p>
<p>Fix the actual problem - whether it be how the libraries used are built OR it may be redundant scripted requirements from legacy code that has been re-introduced.</p>
</ul>

<strong>JTDX-specific Dependency issue</strong>s
<ul>	
  <p>There is a JTDX-specific build issue (that may have already been addressed) that can be fixed quite easily by adding components into the WIndows search path.
  </p><p>On your Windows Destop:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Start the <em>Windows Control Panel</em> (setps assumed to be known - i.e. Start / Run / Control).</li>
		<li>Select <em>System / Advanced System Properties / Advanced / Environment Variables</em></li>
		<li>Under &quot;User variables for &lt;user&gt;&quot;, <u>double-click on &quot;path&quot;</u></li>
		<li>In the &quot;Edit environment variable&quot; dialog add the following two entries:</li>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Click New ==&gt; <strong>C:\Windows\SysWOW64\downlevel </strong></li>
		    <li>Click New ==&gt; <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\hamlib\qt\5.15.2\bin</strong></li>
		    <li> Click Ok / Ok.</li>
      </ul>
	  
	  <li>It is now advisable to reboot your system.</li>
  </ul>
		
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a temporary work-arround (if it has not been addressed already). Hopefully JTDX CMakeFile scripts will be updated in a future release so these patches are no longer requried.</p>
	
</ul>
</ul>
<h3>Step 4: Build your JT- Software</h3>

<ul>
  <p>The release-source-code pulled is for the latest JT-software release. The JT-source that you pull is configurable from <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools\config</strong>. Rename the file <strong>src-wsjtx</strong> from a default pull of WSJT-X to either <strong>src-jtdx</strong> or <strong>src-js8call</strong> if desired. </p>
  <p>The &quot;major&quot; used Jt-ware distributions are supported without discrimination or political comment.</p>
	<p>In JTSDK64-Tools:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Type: <strong>jtbuild</strong>      i.e. <strong>jtbuild package</strong></li>
	</ul>
  <p>Options preferred are <strong>package</strong> (a Windows Installer package - the preferred &quot;clean&quot; way) and <strong>rinstall</strong> (just a static directory full of &quot;runnable&quot; files).</p>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Additional Options for Developers</h2>
<hr>
<ul>

<p>Both the <strong>jtbuild</strong> and <strong>build-hamlib-</strong> scripts now contain a number of switches that can be used to disable default features of the scripts.</p>
<p>Use the embedded <strong>help</strong> facilities to discover the currently available set of switches:</p>
<p><strong>i.e. 1</strong>:  In The <strong>PowerShell</strong> Environment:</p>
</ul>
<div class="reducewidth">
<pre>
PS C:\JTSDK64-Tools> jtbuild -h

--------------------------------------------
 Default Build Commands
--------------------------------------------

 Usage .....: jtbuild [ OPTION ] [[ SWITCH ]]

 Examples...: jtbuild rinstall
            : jtbuild rinstall -ng

 Options:

    rconfig    Release, Config Only
    dconfig    Debug, Config Only
    rinstall   Release, Non-packaged Install
    dinstall   Debug, Non-packaged Install
    package    Release, Windows Package
    docs       Release, User Guide

 Switches:

    Switches only work if an [ OPTION ] is supplied.

    -nc        Do not run configure
    -ng        Do not check/pull source

 * To Display this message, type .....: jtbuild -h

PS C:\JTSDK64-Tools>
</pre>
</div>
<ul>
<p><strong>i.e. 2</strong>:  In The <strong>MSYS2</strong> Environment:</p>
</ul>
<div class="reducewidth">
<pre>

---------------------------------------------------------------
 BUILD-HAMLIB - HELP
---------------------------------------------------------------

* Available Command Line Options:

  --> -h ........: Help
  --> -b/-nb ....: Process / Do not process bootstrap
  --> -c/-nc ....: Process / Do not process configure
  --> -g/-ng ....: Process / Do not pull/check source from GIT repository
  --> -libusb ...: Configure with LibUSB support
  --> -nlibusb ..: Do not configure with LibUSB support
  --> -static ...: Statically Linked Libraries built
       or ..
  --> -dynamic ..: Shared/Dynamically Linked Libraries built

* Note: You cannot select -static with -dynamic

  If using switches you may need to combine options to over-ride default build behaviour:

  i.e.: build-hamlib -nb reverts to Hamlib default STATIC build behaviour
        build-hamlib -nb -dynamic over-rides this behaviour
