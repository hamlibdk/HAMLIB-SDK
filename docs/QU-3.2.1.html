	<h2>JTSDK 3.2.1 Common Questions</h2>
	<hr>
	<h3>What has happened to the original JTSDK creator?</h3>
    <ul>
		<p><a href="https://github.com/KI7MT">Greg Beam KI7MT</a> is still around and with us on the JTSDK Forum at <a href="https://groups.io/g/JTSDK">jtsdk@groups.io</a>. People's interests change; you will see from Greg's posts that he has evolved past active JTSDK development.</a> 
		<p>We cannot thank Greg more highly for his past and ongoing work - especially as a mentor at this point in time.</p>
	<p>No politics here. This is not a push out or push aside. The 'hamlibdk' group as entities seek no glory nor recognition. Contributors just evolved work where Greg left off as the need was there for this to occur.</p>
<p>Other developers have gone silent (but may still be around in the background) due to some of the nastiness in our environment.&nbsp;</p>
</ul>
	<h3>Where can I ask question ?</h3>
    <ul>
	  <p>The original JTSDK Forum <a href="https://groups.io/g/JTSDK">jtsdk@groups.io</a> is used as the primary communication point for this project.</p>
		<p>Have no hesitations posting questions to there. If you are unable to post then email main contributors in that forum directly.</p>
	</ul>
	<h3>What happens if I receive a PowerShell security warning? Is it safe torun the PowerShell Scripts?</h3>
    <ul>
	<p>You may receive the following <strong>security notification</strong>:</p>
	</ul>
<div class="container"> <pre>
Execution Policy Change
The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing 
the execution policy might expose you to the security risks described in the 
about_Execution_Policies help topic at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. 
Do you want to change the execution policy?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"):
</pre>
	</div>
	<ul>
	<p>It is safe to select <strong>Y</strong>. These scripts are not any processor flaw tests. Remember
	that developing these scripts is also a learning exercise for the Development Team.</p>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>How does the SDK use PowerShell? Why does the SDK need to use PowerShell when previous kits used CMD scripts?</h3>
	
	<ul>
	<p>The second part first: PowerShell creates a HIGHLY EXTENSIBLE scripted environment. The PowerShell environment is much more powerful and offers facilities that vastly eclipse capabilities of the old CMD.EXE processor and its scripts. Many tasks became onerous and were pushing the boundaries of what CMD.EXE-capable scripts could perform. Some tasks (such as extracting version information from the <strong>cmake</strong> files) became near impossible with CMD.EXE scripts. Therefore the PowerShell 'universal' scripting environment - provided by Microsoft STANDARD with Windows - was selected as the investigation tool for this project.</p>
	<p>The basic concept of supporting <strong>Windows Environment Variables</strong> through <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">PowerShell</a> 
	<strong>$env:<env-var></strong> facilities ease access into CMake, QMake and the MinGW compilers - components that will always remain a cornerstone concepts.</p>
	</ul>
	
<h3>How do I upgrade existing JTSDK deployments?</h3>
	<ul>
	<p>The <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/JTSDK64-Base-3.2.1.exe">JTSDK64-Base-3.2.1</a> can be installed over the top of previous kits - yet it is 
	highly recommended that one start from scratch. </p>
	<p><strong> It is highly recommended that kits are deployed into Virtual machines (see <a href="DG-3.2.1.html">Installation</a> section).</strong> </p>
	<p>It is highly recommended that a new, fresh deployment be considered with each new base package release.</p>
	<p>You can keep old deployment(s) by closing all open environment windows and renaming the deployment folder (i.e. <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools</strong> to <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools-Old</strong>) </p>
	<p>If you need to revert back to your old deployment then all you need do is rename that folder back to its original filename (i.e. <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools-Old</strong> back to <strong>C:\JTSDK64-Tools</strong>) </p>
	</ul>
	
<h3>How do I update the JTSDK?</h3>
	
	<ul>
	<p>Maintenance updates will be applied in the form of &quot;Tools&quot; packages. These packages 
	are designed to be deployed to existing &quot;Base&quot; packages.</p>
	</ul>
	
<h4>Where do I get and how do I apply 'Tools' packages?</h4>

	<ul>
	  <p><strong></strong>&quot;Tools&quot;</strong> packages are updates to the <strong></strong>&quot;Base&quot;</strong> environments.</p>
	<p><em>These steps assume that you have a deployed base environment</em></p>
	<ul>
	<li>Download any &quot;Tools&quot; packages from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/</a> </li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> The current version is <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib-sdk/files/Windows/JTSDK-3.2-Stream/JTSDK64-Tools-3.2.1.1.exe">JTSDK64-Tools-3.2.1.1.exe</a> .</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Deploy the tools package to your JTSDK install directory.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Updates may apply to the MSYS2 environment. Therefore the &quot;profile&quot; directory for 
	MSYS2 should be deleted and re-created.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>(Optional) Copy any folders stored under <strong>x:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\msys64\home</strong> to a backup location. This should enable you to access previous work.</li>
		
		<li>Close any open MSYS2 environment terminal(s).</li>
		
		<li>Perform the system upgrade.</li>
		
		<li>Delete folders that exist under <strong>x:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\msys64\home</strong>.</li>
	  
		<ul>
			<li>i.e: PowerShell: <strong> Remove-Item &quot;C:\JTSDK64-Tools\tools\msys64\home*&quot; -Recurse -Force </strong></li>
		</ul>
		
		<li>Re-open MSYS2 with the <strong>msys2</strong> command for maintenance or <strong>mingw64</strong> for development work inside the PowerShell terminal</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>src</strong> directory in your backup should contain your previous work. It 
	is safe to copy this enture foler across to your new MSYS2 Profile.</p>
	<p>You will need to pull down your Hamlib repository again and/or restore any custom work 
	to folders created within the MSYS2 environment. See Step 3b below.</p>
	</ul>
